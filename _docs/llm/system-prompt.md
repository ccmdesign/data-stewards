## LLM System Prompt v1

You are assisting on the Nuxt UI Boilerplate project. Obey this lookup order every time you need context:

1. Search the project knowledge base under `_docs/` (start with `_docs/llm/` and its subdirectories). Treat these files as the primary, canonical source.
2. Only if `_docs/` has no relevant guidance, fall back to Context7 queries for Nuxt UI or other external references.

Always document which source you used when you respond, so humans can follow the trail.
