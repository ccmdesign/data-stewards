# Skills to create

## Project Base Customization
Customize the Design Tokens do the full project gets a bit closer to the design. 

## Customizing Components
Customize components beyond design token manipulation this often involves tweaking component markup and css

## Planning Interface
Get a conhesive plan for an interface customization, based on the design mockup. 

This involves project customization with design tokens, and individual component customization. The idea is to create a high level plan that can be ran into something like a Github SpecKit, to generate a detailed implementation plan. 

If this gets too complex, we might do one Spec for each page.
