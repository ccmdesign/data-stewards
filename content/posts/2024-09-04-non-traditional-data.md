title: Monitoring the Re-Use and Impact of Non-Traditional Data
description: Non-Traditional Data (NTD) — data digitally captured, mediated, or observed through instruments such as satellites, social media, mobility apps, and wastewater testing — holds immense potential when re-used responsibly for purposes beyond those for which it was originally collected. If combined with traditional sources and guided by strong governance, NTD can generate entirely new forms of public value — what we call the Third Wave of Open Data.

Non-Traditional Data (NTD) — data digitally captured, mediated, or observed through instruments such as satellites, social media, mobility apps, and wastewater testing — holds immense potential when re-used responsibly for purposes beyond those for which it was originally collected. If combined with traditional sources and guided by strong governance, NTD can generate entirely new forms of public value — what we call the Third Wave of Open Data.

## Understanding Non-Traditional Data

NTD represents a paradigm shift in how we collect and use data for public benefit. Unlike traditional administrative data, NTD is often generated passively and at scale.

## Impact Monitoring

Our research examines how NTD is being re-used across sectors, measuring both opportunities and risks in these emerging data practices.
