The Nairobi Data Commons, co-led by alumni from the 2023 online cohort, has deployed a community reporting dashboard for its health equity partnerships. The dashboard captures key commitments that organizations make when stewarding shared datasets, covering transparency, accountability, and benefit-sharing metrics.

Community stakeholders helped define which indicators would appear on the dashboard. The chapter also created a public log documenting the onboarding process for all new datasets.

Next quarter, the Nairobi team will host a regional salon focused on maintaining community oversight at scale. Their learnings will feed into the Academy's upcoming deep dive on Trust Metrics.
