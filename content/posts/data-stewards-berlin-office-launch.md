The Berlin 2024 foundations bootcamp has culminated in a new citywide stewardship office that will coordinate responsible data collaboration across departments. Alumni worked alongside the Senate Chancellery to frame the office's mandate around the 4P framework—purpose, principles, processes, and practices.

The new unit will:

- Coordinate the design of responsible data collaboratives with mobility, climate, and health teams
- Establish an accountability council that includes residents and civil society advocates
- Publish a stewardship dashboard that tracks trust safeguards and project outcomes

"We now have the structures to link innovation teams with the communities they serve—while meeting legal and ethical obligations," said alumna Helena Bakić, who will serve as the inaugural Stewardship Director.

The office will work closely with the Data Stewards Academy to host quarterly deep dives and maintain alignment with international best practices.
