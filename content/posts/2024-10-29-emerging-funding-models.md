As data becomes an essential input for innovation and AI training, questions of how to sustain its equitable and responsible reuse have gained urgency. Beyond technical infrastructure and governance frameworks, the long-term viability of data commons depends on the institutional and financial models that underpin them.

## The Challenge

Data commons face unique challenges in establishing sustainable funding models. Unlike traditional data repositories, commons must balance multiple stakeholder interests while ensuring equitable access and responsible use.

## Key Findings

Our research compares various funding approaches, from membership models to public-private partnerships, examining their effectiveness in supporting long-term data stewardship goals.
