Artificial Intelligence is only as good as the data it draws upon. For public-interest uses — from emergency response to localized decision making — high-quality, representative, and responsibly governed datasets are essential. Yet too often, the data needed for humanitarian interventions or local problem-solving is fragmented, inaccessible, or not aligned with community needs and expectations.
