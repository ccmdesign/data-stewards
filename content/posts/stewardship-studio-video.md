# Stewardship Studio — Rapid Trust Assessments in 20 Minutes

This session demonstrates how to facilitate the Academy’s rapid trust assessment canvas inside a product discovery sprint. Facilitator Priya Ananth walks through a live scenario with a mobility startup and a municipal data office, highlighting how teams can:
