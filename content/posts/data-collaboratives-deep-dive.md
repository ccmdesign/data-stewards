# Building Responsible Data Collaboratives — A Practitioner's Guide

This comprehensive session brings together three practitioners who have launched and sustained data collaboratives across health, mobility, and climate domains. They share concrete frameworks, common pitfalls, and real-world examples of how to design governance structures that build trust while enabling innovation.

## Key topics covered

- **Partnership models** — From bilateral agreements to multi-party consortiums, learn which structures work best for different data types and use cases.
- **Consent and authorization** — Practical approaches to obtaining and maintaining community consent in dynamic, multi-year collaborations.
- **Value distribution** — How to design benefit-sharing mechanisms that ensure affected communities see tangible returns from data reuse.
- **Governance councils** — Templates for setting up advisory boards that include residents, civil society, and technical experts.

## Case studies featured

1. **Health Equity Data Commons** — A public-private partnership that aggregates anonymized health data to inform public health interventions while maintaining strict privacy safeguards.
2. **Mobility Data Exchange** — A city-led initiative where transit agencies share real-time usage data with researchers and startups under clear stewardship agreements.
3. **Climate Resilience Hub** — Regional governments pooling environmental sensor data to support climate adaptation planning, with community oversight at every stage.
