The Data Stewards Academy has released a beta version of the Social License Playbook, built from workshop notes, community feedback, and over thirty alumni case studies. The playbook packages conversation guides, readiness assessments, and policy templates that support responsible data collaborations.

Inside the playbook you will find:

- A readiness diagnostic that helps teams align on purpose, principles, processes, and practices
- Scenario templates for communicating value propositions with residents and partners
- Checklists for documenting consent pathways, trust safeguards, and accountability plans

Alumni can download the playbook from the Resource Library and co-develop additional modules through the #social-license Slack channel. Feedback collected this quarter will shape the first public release in early 2026.
