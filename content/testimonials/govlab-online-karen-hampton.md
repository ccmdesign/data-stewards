This course is a wonderful resource for any organization considering creating, expanding, or refining data use strategies and processes. Every presentation, reading, and discussion added depth and breadth to data stewardship. The course combines methodology and application for an immediate return on investment at all stages of data strategy and implementation. I look forward to continued contact with program leads and peers to grow my project and skills.
