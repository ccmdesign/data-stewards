This course was an incredible opportunity to learn from experienced peers, receive mentorship from academic and industry experts, and set strategy for a post-pandemic world where public institutions need to set priorities with data. It has been an honor to be part of this inaugural cohort of data stewards, and I look forward to contributing to our growing community.
