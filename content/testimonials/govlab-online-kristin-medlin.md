What an honor to stand in the presence of such brilliant and thoughtful colleagues. It was refreshing to be around people thinking deeply about data strategy. Peer presentations helped me feel as if I wasn't alone in my wanderings and validated that my path was appropriate—there was no train I had missed while everyone else sped ahead.
