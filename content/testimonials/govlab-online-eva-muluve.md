As the saying goes, "In a world befogged by superficiality, moments of clarity are few and far between." The executive data stewardship course by GovLab offers that rare and special light bulb moment. The organization of the course was excellent and the choice of facilitators exceptional. In just a few weeks, we gained knowledge, practical skills, and a deeper understanding of what data stewardship is—and learned how, as leaders, we can develop data re-use strategies to solve public problems. I am happy to have been part of the amazing first eastern hemisphere cohort.
