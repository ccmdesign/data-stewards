During the Centre for Humanitarian Data's session we had a lively conversation with an engaged audience of professionals from a wide variety of backgrounds. The cohort quickly grasped the core of the Centre's activities and related them to their own work, leading to immediate lessons on data sensitivity classifications, the importance of trust, and the benefits of open data sharing.
