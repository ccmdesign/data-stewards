In eight short weeks, I saw data stewardship in action like never before. The combination of lectures on the data stewardship framework, virtual site visits, and guest lectures from practitioners across the globe served to center my resolve in my own work. The participant cohort was incredible, and the read-ahead materials were a goldmine of actionable resources. Every class offered takeaways I could put into play immediately, and I plan to revisit segments to strengthen my understanding.
