It was a pleasure to spend the week in Berlin with a cohort of data stewards under the instruction of Stefaan Verhulst and the team at the Data Tank. The program was well run and gave us opportunities to meet and work with organisations focused on the sustainable and responsible re-use of data for public benefit.
