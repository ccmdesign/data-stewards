The Data Stewards Academy experience has been extremely relevant and valuable to the work I am doing. Learning how others have tackled similar challenges has been both enlightening and reassuring—I'm not alone. The course helped me gain a better understanding of different approaches to data governance and emerging concepts in data stewardship, and how these are applied in different organizational, social, and cultural contexts.
