This course was an excellent opportunity to park for some time the "urgent" tasks and the noise, and reflect about the bigger scope when dealing with data. In addition to the excellent lectures provided by Stefaan and the rest of the DataTank team, I found inspiring guest talks and a vibrant cohort of enthusiasts that will help shape the future of data in the public and non-profit sectors.
